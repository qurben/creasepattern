creasepattern
=============

Convert `.cp` files to `.png`

Size of the output image is based on the sizes given in the `.cp` file.

## Usage

    from creasepattern import cp2png
    
    cp2png('file.cp', 'file.png')

## Roadmap

* (Must) Make size of output configurable
* (Must) Make edge types configurable
* (Could) Support more filetypes
